CALINE3 provides an interface to a Fortran 77 implementation of the CALINE3 line-source atmospheric dispersion model. This steady-state, Gaussian dispersion model is used to predict pollutant concentrations downwind from mobile emission sources such as highway traffic. 

CALIEN3 is enhanced (and required) by the [Rcaline package](http://github.com/BAAQMD/Rcaline).
